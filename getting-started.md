# Getting Started

📁 [Starter code](starter-code)

The starter code for this part of the project contains one folder named `chess_phase2.dataAccess`.

In a File Explorer (outside of IntelliJ), copy the `chess_phase2.dataAccess` folder from the provided starter code into the `src/starter` folder. This folder contains the DataAccessException class. If the methods on your data access classes throw exceptions, they should be DataAccessExceptions. This class should not be modified.

The end result should be two packages named `chess` and `chess_phase2.dataAccess` in your `src/starter` folder.
